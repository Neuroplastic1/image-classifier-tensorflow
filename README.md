# image-classifier-tensorflow
A basic structure of an image-classifier model with tensorflow

A simplified example of how to go about creating an image classifier using Python and TensorFlow.

Utilized a basic approach using the pre-trained model MobileNetV2 for image classification. 

You'll need to have TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub installed in your Python environment for this to work.

First, install necessary libraries: 

```console
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-hub
pip install pillow
```

Notes: We'll need to replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the path to the image we want to classify.

This script uses a model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which can recognize 1000 different object categories. If we want to recognize objects outside of these categories, we would need to train your model on a custom dataset.

Additionally this is a very simple implementation. In a production setting, we'd likely want to have more robust code that can handle different types of input errors and potentially use a more complex model or a different approach entirely, depending on the problem we're trying to solve.
